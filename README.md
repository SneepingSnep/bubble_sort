# BubbleSort
In this weeks problem i have played with pointers to make a bubblesort. I have used heap allocated pointers for this task. just because i like it.
The code works by first creating a array with random integers, and after that it will bubblesort it and print each iteration of the sortet array.

I have also played around with the Makefile to make it run both on linux and windows.
for LINUX
//////////
"make mainl" will compile the code
"make gol" will build and run the code
"make cleanl" will clean the object files in the src folder
//////////
for WINDOWS
//////////
"make mainw" will compile the code
"make gow" will build and run the code
"make cleanw" will clean the object files in the src folder
//////////
